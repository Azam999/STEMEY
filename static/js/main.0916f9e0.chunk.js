Liu was born in 1982 in Shanghai, China and grew up in Tucson, AZ. Starting at a young age, Liu pursued a career as a concert pianist, but shifted his primary interest to chemistry when he was a sophomore at Harvard, where he conducted undergraduate research with Professor Stuart Schreiber. After graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard in 2005 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry, Liu joined the laboratory of Professor Peter Schultz at the Scripps Research Institute. There, he expanded the genetic code of bacteria for the co-translational incorporation of otherwise post-translational modifications and provided the first demonstrations that expanded genetic codes can be selectively advantageous in the evolution of novel protein function. Liu earned his PhD in chemistry in 2009, after which he became a Miller Fellow at UC Berkeley. Working with Professor Adam Arkin, Liu conducted research in the field of synthetic biology and developed methods for the predictable creation of complex regulatory systems. In 2013, Liu started his lab at UC Irvine.",position:"Associate Professor"}))))}}]),t}(n.Component);var An=function(){return
